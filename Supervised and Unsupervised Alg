Supervised and unsupervised learning are two main types of machine learning.
In supervised learning, the model is trained with labeled data where each input has a corresponding output.
On the other hand, unsupervised learning involves training the model with unlabeled data which helps to uncover patterns, structures or relationships within the data without predefined outputs.
What is Supervised Learning?
Imagine teaching a child to identify different fruits. You show them an apple and say “apple,” then you show them a banana and say “banana.”
